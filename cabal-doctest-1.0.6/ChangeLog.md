# 1.0.6 -- 2018-01-28

* Hook `haddock` build too. Fixes issue when `haddock` fails, as
  `Build_doctests` isn't generated.

# 1.0.5 -- 2018-01-26

* Add a hack so `Build_doctests` module is automatically added to
  to `other-modules` and `autogen-modules` when compiled with Cabal-2.0.
  Thanks to that, we don't get warnings because of `-Wmissing-home-modules`.

# 1.0.4 -- 2017-12-05

* Add support for doctests in executables and (with `Cabal-2.0` or later)
  internal libraries. Refer to the `README` for more details.

# 1.0.3 -- 2017-11-02

* Add an explicit `Prelude` import to `Build_doctests`

# 1.0.2 -- 2017-05-16

* Add `defaultMainAutoconfWithDoctests` and `addDoctestsUserHook`.

* Add support for `.hsc` and other preprocessed files
  ([#8](https://github.com/phadej/cabal-doctest/issues/8))

* Add support for `x-doctest-source-dirs` and `x-doctest-modules`.

# 1.0.1 -- 2017-05-05

* Add support for `x-doctest-options` cabal-file field

* Proper support for GHC-8.2.1 & Cabal-2.0.0.0

* Add support to `default-extensions` in library.

# 1  -- 2017-01-31

* First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.
